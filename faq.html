                <li> <b>A:</b> You can contact the seller to request a cancellation or change,
                        but it depends on the seller's policies. Some sellers allow order changes

                <br>

                <li><b>A:</b> Boiler Business automatically calculates and collects
                        sales tax in certain regions, but you are responsible for setting up tax settings
                        for other locations where you have tax obligations. You can manage this in your

                    the tracking information to see if it’s still in transit. If it’s delayed or missing
                        contact the seller directly. </li>
