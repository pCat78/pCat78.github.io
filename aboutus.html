                <h2>What We Do:</h2>
                <p>
                    Boiler Businesses is a platform that allows Purdue students 
                    to easily discover small businesses of the students on campus
                    and helps small businesses find more possibly interested clients.
                    There are many Purdue students who post on their social 
                    media about the services they offer such as haircuts, 
                    nail art, crocheting, tattoos, piercings, and so much more.
                    Because this is the only way they can reach their audience
                    of people specifically on Purdue’s campus, they struggle
                    to make their business known to many. Boiler Businesses
                    gives small businesses a platform to display their 
                    products and services to locals.

                    <h2>Goals:</h2>
                    <p>Boiler Business’s goal is to help the small businesses of Purdue 
                    find new clients and service opportunities. A common issue small businesses
                    face is difficulty in getting their name and business discovered in society.
                    We saw this issue and wanted to make a more easily accessible way to learn of 
                    Purdue’s small businesses. We not only want to make it easier for small 
                    businesses to find more clients, but also to help Purdue students find the 
                    product or service that best fits their needs. This platform allows Purdue 
                    students to see all the businesses on campus and see details about what they 
                    offer. Students can also rate the businesses and hear about other client’s 
                    experiences with their services and products.
